# xAPI Player

xAPI Player defines the JSON structure of a course or unit and can help when developing an authoring tool and implementing a course player.

It can be used when creating an implementation that sends xAPI statements to a Learning Record Store (LRS), defining when the learner has met the requirements for sending statements for certain xAPI verbs. The JSON definition may also be used when implementing the cmi5 specification, defining the pass and completion of a unit.
